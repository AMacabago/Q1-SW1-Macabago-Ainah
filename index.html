		<hr>
		<p style="text-align: center;">Whenever I have the time, I like to play <em>games that are accesible on mobile or on my macbook</em>. <br> I also like to play <em>games when I'm bored</em> and when <em>I feel like playing it</em>. My favorite games are <strong>Mobile Legends, Sims 4, Roblox, and Minecraft</strong>. <br>Firstly, I like playing <strong>Mobile Legends</strong> because of its <mark>high quality and the various ways to play heroes on it</mark>. Secondly, I like playing <strong>Sims 4</strong> because of <mark>roleplay gameplay that makes your relaxed rather than stressed</mark>. Thirdly, I like playing <strong>Roblox</strong> because of the <mark>various games it offers in just one app</mark>. Lastly, I like playing <strong>Minecraft</strong> because it's an <mark>adventure game that you'd have to work hard on to unlock specific items</mark>.  </p>
